## Part 2: Install Anaconda Python, Create the course Environment and Create a Jupyter Notebook

1. Download and install Anaconda 3 Individual Edition from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

    - Windows: 64-Bit Graphical Installer
    - MacOS: (recommended) 64-Bit Command Line Installer
    - Linux: 64-Bit (x86) Installer

    Follow the instructions here for your os: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
    (recommended) “Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?” : “yes”. 

2. Open a new command line terminal
    - Windows: Start -> Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3)
    - MacOS: Command+Space -> "Terminal"
    - Linux: Terminal

3. Navigate to where you cloned the course repo
    
        (base) $ cd ~/proj/eods-f21

4. If you are in the base anaconda environment, you should see `(base)` in the shell prompt (see example above).
If you don't see `(base)`, activate the base environment with:
    
        $ conda activate
    
5. Create a new virtual environment using the requirements file:

        (base) $ conda env create -f docs/requirements.yml

6. Activate the new environment

        (base) $ conda activate eods-f21

7. Add the new environment to jupyter

        (eods-f21) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name eods-f21
        
8. Return to the base environment and launch Jupyter Notebook server

        (eods-s21) $ conda deactivate
        (base) $ jupyter notebook

9. In Jupyter, navigate to the folder: weekly_quiz/

10. Open a new notebook using the newly created kernel: New -> eods-f21

11. Rename the notebook "Week_01_Quiz-UNI", replacing UNI with your uniqname

12. In the first cell, copy the following code and run:

import sys
import pandas
import sklearn
print('python version:',sys.version)
print('pandas version:',pandas.__version__)
print('sklearn version:',sklearn.__version__)
print('pandas path:',pandas.__path__)
